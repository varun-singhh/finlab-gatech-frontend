## Programming Task for Summer Research

### Task Description:

The task for this summer research project involves processing the 10K filings of companies from 1995-2023 using the LLM API and creating a visualization report based on the extracted data.

### Task Components:

1. **Data Processing:** Utilize the LLM API to extract relevant financial data from the 10K filings of companies spanning the years 1995-2023. The extracted data includes income statement, balance sheet, cash flow statement, financial metrics, and business insights.

2. **Visualization Report:** Create a visualization report based on the extracted data. The report should include visualizations and insights derived from the financial data.

### Data Sample:

```json
{
  "incomeStatement": {
    "netIncome": 257.6,
    "netIncomePerShare": 30.62,
    "dilutedEarningsPerShare": 29.96,
    "EBITDA": 346.2,
    "operatingIncome": 260.1,
    "revenue": 257.6
  },
  "balanceSheet": {
    "totalAssets": 439.5,
    "totalLiabilities": 185.2,
    "totalEquity": 254.3,
    "cashAndCashEquivalents": 142.8,
    "shortTermInvestments": 10.1,
    "accountsReceivableNet": 51.6
  },
  "cashFlowStatement": {
    "netCashProvidedByOperatingActivities": 145.4,
    "netCashUsedInInvestingActivities": 10.9,

  },
  "financialMetrics": {
    "revenue": 257.6,
    "netIncome": 20.6,
    "earningsPerShare": 2.65,
    "freeCashFlow": 56.1
  },
  "businessInsights": {
    "revenueGrowth": "23%",
    "netIncomeGrowth": "18%",
    "earningsPerShareGrowth": "15%",
    "freeCashFlowGrowth": "31%"
  }
}
```

```
Please note that the actual data and insights should be replaced with those derived from the 10K filings processed during the research project.

## Visualization Report Insights:

### Revenue Growth:

This insight indicates a significant increase in revenue over the specified period. It reflects the company's ability to generate more income from its operations, which is crucial for its financial health and growth prospects.

### Net Income Growth:

The growth in net income signifies the company's profitability and efficiency in managing expenses. A consistent increase in net income is a positive indicator of financial performance.

### Earnings Per Share Growth:

Earnings per share (EPS) growth is essential for shareholders as it represents the portion of a company's profit allocated to each outstanding share of common stock. A rising EPS indicates improved profitability and value for shareholders.

### Free Cash Flow Growth:

Free cash flow (FCF) growth indicates the amount of cash generated by a company's operations after accounting for capital expenditures. A higher FCF allows companies to invest in growth opportunities, pay dividends, or reduce debt.

## Conclusion:

The visualization report based on the extracted financial data provides valuable insights into the company's financial performance and growth trajectory. Understanding these insights is crucial for making informed investment decisions and assessing the overall health of the company.
